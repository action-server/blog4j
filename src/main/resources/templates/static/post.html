            Arch Linux (/ɑːrtʃ/)[4] is a Linux distribution for computers with x86-64 processors.[5] Arch Linux adheres
            to the KISS principle ("Keep It Simple, Stupid")[6] and is focused on simplicity, modernity, pragmatism,
            user centrality, and versatility. In practice, this means the project attempts to have minimal
            distribution-specific changes, and therefore minimal breakage with updates, and be pragmatic over
            ideological design choices and focus on customizability rather than user-friendliness.[7] A package manager
            written specifically for Arch Linux, Pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.[8]
            Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major releases" of completely new versions of
            the system; a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the
            installation images released every month by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system
            components.[9] Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation, which consists of a community wiki known as the
            ArchWiki. Inspired by CRUX, another minimalist distribution, Judd Vinet started the Arch Linux project in
            March 2002. The name was chosen because Vinet liked the word's meaning of "the principal," as in
            "arch-enemy".[4][13] Originally only for 32-bit x86 CPUs, the first x86_64 installation ISO was released in
            April 2006.[14] Vinet led Arch Linux until 1 October 2007, when he stepped down due to lack of time,
            transferring control of the project to Aaron Griffin.[15] The migration to systemd as its init system
            started in August 2012,[16] and it became the default on new installations in October 2012.[17] It replaced
            the SysV-style init system, used since the distribution inception.[18] On 24 February 2020, Aaron Griffin
            announced that due to his limited involvement with the project, he would, after a voting period, transfer
            control of the project to Levente Polyak.[19] This change also led to a new 2-year term period being added
            to the Project Leader position.[20] The end of i686 support was announced in January 2017, with the February
            2017 ISO being the last one including i686[21] and making the architecture unsupported in November 2017.[22]
            Since then, the community derivative Arch Linux 32 can be used for i686 hardware. Repository security Until
            Pacman version 4.0.0,[23] Arch Linux's package manager lacked support for signed packages.[24] Packages and
            metadata were not verified for authenticity by Pacman during the download-install process. Without package
            authentication checking, tampered-with or malicious repository mirrors could compromise the integrity of a
            system.[25] Pacman 4 allowed verification of the package database and packages, but it was disabled by
            default. In November 2011, package signing became mandatory for new package builds, and as of 21 March 2012,
            every official package is signed.[26] In June 2012, package signing verification became official and is now
            enabled by default in the installation process.[27][28] Design and principles Arch is largely based on
            binary packages. Packages target x86-64 microprocessors to assist performance on modern hardware. A
            ports/ebuild-like system is also provided for automated source compilation, known as the Arch Build
            System.[29] Arch Linux focuses on simplicity of design, meaning that the main focus involves creating an
            environment that is straightforward and relatively easy for the user to understand directly, rather than
            providing polished point-and-click style management tools — the package manager, for example, does not have
            an official graphical front-end. This is largely achieved by encouraging the use of succinctly commented,
            clean configuration files that are arranged for quick access and editing.[30] This has earned it a
            reputation as a distribution for "advanced users" who are willing to use the command line.[31] Relying on
            complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end-users. [...] "If you try to hide the
            complexity of the system, you'll end up with a more complex system". Layers of abstraction that serve to
            hide internals are never a good thing. Instead, the internals should be designed in a way such that they
            NEED no hiding. — Aaron Griffin
